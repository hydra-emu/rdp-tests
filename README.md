My collection of RDP tests

To build these you need the unstable branch of libdragon

The output of these tests has been verified on a real N64

:warning: The expected output PNGs are screenshots either from my emulator or from ares and should not be considered "perfect expected output". Eventually I want to export the framebuffer from real hardware and use that as the expected output images, but for now they should be used simply as an idea of the expected output. Users are encouraged to run the tests on their own real hardware as well.
